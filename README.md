# Open Amiga

An index of the Open Amiga family: free software for AmigaOS 3.2 (m68k) from
Dalsin Limited, made for AmigaChrome and usable on real Amigas and PiStorm.
Each project lives in its own repository with its own README and licence.

## Library ports

Open-source libraries ported to AmigaOS 3.2 (m68k), first for OpenBrowser.
Each repository holds the Amiga build (script, patches, configuration), a
smoke test with its output, and the library's upstream licence; the Amiga
changes are MIT. "Working" means it builds and its smoke test passed on
AmigaOS 3.2.3 under AmigaChrome; none has been run on real hardware yet.

## Datatypes

Datatypes the project builds, so any datatypes program (MultiView,
OpenBrowser, a picture viewer) opens more formats. They all live in
[openamigaimage](https://github.com/DalsinAI/openamigaimage)'s `Datatypes`
drawer, run on a 68020 or better without an FPU, and decode on AmigaOS 3.2.3
under AmigaChrome exactly as their libraries do on x86 cores; none has been run on
real hardware yet.

| Datatype | Opens | Built on | State, 4 October 2026 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `webp.datatype` | WebP pictures: lossy, lossless, alpha (first frame of an animated one) | libwebp 1.6.0 (openamigamedialibrary) | Working |
| `webm.datatype` | WebM video, VP8 and VP9, as an animation in 256 colours; no sound yet | libvpx 1.17.0 (openamigamedialibrary) | Frames decode; playback in MultiView not yet checked |

## AmigaChrome tools
